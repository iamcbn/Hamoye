When dealing with outliers in regression analysis, robust regression metrics are preferred as they are less influenced by extreme values compared to traditional metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. One such robust metric is the mean absolute error (MAE).

Here's why MAE is more robust to outliers:

1. **Impact of outliers:** Outliers can have a significant impact on traditional regression metrics like MSE, as they involve squaring the errors. A single large residual caused by an outlier can inflate the MSE substantially. On the other hand, MAE only considers the absolute differences between predicted and actual values, making it less sensitive to extreme values.

2. **Absolute errors:** MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Since it does not square the errors, it gives equal weight to all errors, regardless of their magnitude. This makes MAE more resistant to the influence of outliers compared to MSE.

3. **Interpretation:** MAE is easier to interpret than MSE, as it represents the average magnitude of errors in the same units as the dependent variable. This makes it more intuitive for understanding the model's performance, especially in the presence of outliers.

4. **Robustness:** Due to its resistance to outliers, MAE provides a more stable measure of model performance across different datasets and in the presence of noisy or skewed data.

In summary, when dealing with datasets containing outliers, using mean absolute error (MAE) as a regression metric is generally more robust and reliable compared to metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
